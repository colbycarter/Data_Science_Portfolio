# Data Science Portfolio
This repository contains a sample of Colby's data science project work from UC Berkeley MIDS graduate program. Key projects have been selected from the following course subjects:

1. _Experiment_. A survey-based experiment testing for a causal effect on economic optimism.

2. _Machine Learning_. A Kaggle classification problem using NLP features to predict whether written online requests for pizza delivery were satisfied.

3. _NLP_. A clustering exercise using NLP features on the Enron email dataset to see whether pockets of fraudulent or suspicious language can be identified more generally.

4. _Python_. Object-based programming for workouts and data exploration and visualization using pandas.

5. _Research Design_. Research on areas of opportunity for using data and algorithms to assist with real-world problems like transit congestion and crime prevention.

6. _Statistics_. Sample reports using statistical modeling in R, such as classical OLS regression, multinomial logistic regression, and SARIMA modeling.

7. _Data Engineering_. (work in progress)
