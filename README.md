# Data Science Portfolio
This repository contains a sample of Colby's data science project work from UC Berkeley MIDS graduate program. Key projects have been selected from the following course subjects:

1. _Statistics_. Sample reports using statistical modeling in R, including classical OLS regression, multinomial logistic regression, and SARIMA modeling.

2. _Experiment_. A survey-based experiment using random assignment that tested for a causal effect of references to the president on economic optimism.

3. _Machine Learning_. A Kaggle classification problem using NLP and other generated features to predict whether written online requests for pizza delivery were satisfied.

4. _NLP_. A clustering and topic-modeling exercise using NLP features on the Enron email dataset to see whether pockets of fraudulent or suspicious language can be identified more generally.

5. _Data Engineering_. An analysis of San Francisco bike-share datasets using Google BigQuery from the command line in Jupyter notebook.

6. _Python_. Object-based programming for workouts and data exploration and visualization using pandas.

7. _Research Design_. Research on areas of opportunity for using data and algorithms to assist with real-world problems like transit congestion and crime prevention.
