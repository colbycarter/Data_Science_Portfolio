Master of Information and Data Science, completed May 2019    
University of California, Berkeley

This repository contains a sample of Colby's data science project work from UC Berkeley's MIDS graduate program, plus personal tutorials on data science tools. Key projects have been selected from the following completed course subjects:

0. _Capstone_. This master's culminated in a group project in which our team built a web app-based product that guides the collection of mountain bike accelerometer data and generates component-level model predictions to proactively identify part degradation and necessary maintenance (Spring 2019).

1. _Statistics_. Sample reports using statistical modeling in R, including classical OLS regression, multinomial logistic regression, and SARIMA modeling (2017).

2. _Experiments & Causality_. A survey-based experiment using random assignment that tested for a causal effect of references to the president on economic optimism (Spring 2018).

3. _Machine Learning_. A factorization machine built for parallelization in Spark, predicting the CTR for the full Criteo ad dataset (Fall 2018). Also, a Kaggle classification problem using NLP tools in Python and generated features to predict whether written online requests for pizza delivery were satisfied (Fall 2017).

4. _Natural Language Processing_. A clustering and topic-modeling exercise using NLP features on the Enron email dataset to see whether pockets of fraudulent or suspicious language can be identified more generally (Spring 2018).

5. _Data Engineering_. An analysis of San Francisco bike-share datasets using Google BigQuery from the command line in Jupyter notebook and building a data pipeline using kafka (Summer 2018).

6. _Python_. Object-based programming for workouts and data exploration and visualization using pandas (Spring 2017).

7. _Research Design_. Research on areas of opportunity for using data and algorithms to assist with real-world problems like transit congestion and crime prevention (Spring 2017).

8. _Tutorials_. Post-Berkeley demonstrations of data science tools explored for personal or professional interest, including webscraping, search engine and Causal Impact (>2019).
