### Introduction, from page 1

In the uncharted world of the Donald Trump presidency, there is an abundance of division, misinformation,
confirmation bias, and at times cognitive dissonance. While there is nothing new about partisan politics and
presidential approval dividing along political lines, we suspect that Trump elicits a distinctive emotional
response from many that transcends this typical political divide. For example, as mainstream media sources
have been clear in their opposition–such as the Washington Post’s post-inauguration slogan[1], “Democracy
Dies in Darkness”–many conservative media and political pundits have reacted to the rise of Trump similarly,
with National Review publishing an issue[2] titled “Against Trump,” prior to election day. We wonder whether
this strong emotional response is prevalent and felt outside of the media and political punditry and seek to
test whether even a subtle reminder of Trump can cause a moment of cognitive dissonance (i.e. inconsistent
beliefs triggered by emotion). Or, alternatively, do we observe that typical Americans are consistent in their
levels of optimism about the most important aspects of their lives, irrespective of who is president?
