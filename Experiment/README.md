### Conclusion

While we are relieved to find little evidence that a reminder of Trump affects important measures optimism
within our sample, we consider several possible explanations and limitations of the study. First, we hope that
there is no true treatment effect because despite what is portrayed across political media, most respondents
are not affected when it comes to the more important priorities in life; for example, few in the political
media expected an election day win for Trump. Along those lines, we wonder whether there has been any
temporal shift in the roughly year and a half since the peak of election campaigning; perhaps individuals who
were once emotionally triggered by Trump have regressed to their mean levels of optimism. Alternatively,
we expect that there are still segments of the population who would have a heterogeneous treatment effect,
but that our collected subject attributes do not identify that segment; because of the diverse preferences
of our respondents, estimating the average treatment effect may not be a strong measure. Or, more likely,
those who are most affected by Trump are highly cognizant of his presidency all the time, and have thus
adjusted their optimism levels accordingly. Lastly, our survey is limited to Mechanical Turks who may not be
representative of the larger American population: while MTurk tends to represent the younger people well
and our sample appears to reflect population proportions across several covariates, it still seems likely that a
particular type of individual is drawn to survey-taking through the platform and may be inherently different
than the rest of the population.
