DGDG DGDGDGDG. rozel after reviewing the prospect with ecr technical personnel and receiving approval to do so sought to acquire top leases over the prospect only to find that others had already top-leased a significant portion of the prospect <s> had the kelley lease expired these parties would have controlled and drilled the prospect <s> rozel with the help of allen wilhite approached kelley for a farmout <s> kelley asked to be presented with a prospect review under the concept that kelley would be willing to farmout approximately DGDG % of its interest or farmout all of its interest retaining an orri convertible to a wi apo or higher orri at its option <s> kelley elected to participate for DGDG % of its interest in the well before the farmout agreement was drafted <s> kelley agreed to general terms in a brief letter agreement <s> kelley sought to operate the well which ecr rejected due to kelley 's poor track record in drilling deep s. louisiana wells <s> rozel energy is the operator in absence of enron having an operating vehicle <s> rozel employed a seasoned contract operator in s. louisiana stokes and speiler who are being managed daily by arvel martin and bob devine who each have over DGDG years experience in mangement of drilling operations <s> inasmuch as the operation of the well was in dispute the negotiation of the joa and the farmout agreement was strained and kelley was non-responsive to allen 's efforts to finalize the agreement <s> allen craig fox arvel martin and i met with kelley 's land manager and vp of operations and established a dialogue and rapport ( we thought ) <s> the initial draft of the farmout agreement was put together on sept. 15th by kelley and allen <s> allen did not share the draft with you then as we were still apart on certain deal provisions particularly who would operate <s> ecr members were in dispute over the importance of operations <s> with kelley 's consent and our high level of confidence that we would reach terms with kelley we moved our rig in and spudded the well a few days prior to the sept. 28th lease expiration <s> allen and i continued to be frustrated with not reaching final contract terms with kelley after the well was spudded <s> i pressed allen to finalize an agreement and he presented an agreement signed by kelley on october DGDG DGDGDGDG ( effective sept. DGDG DGDGDGDG ) <s> following my signature and upon his departure to kelley 's offices to deliver the document i asked him if you had reviewed joa and he said no <s> i asked him if it was required or customary for legal to review joas and he said it was sometimes done but there are rarely revisions <s> i did not ask specifically about farmout agreements <s> the kelley farmout was the first farmout in a directly-owned asset that i had encountered <s> i failed to recognize the distinction between numerous farmouts that i had seen executed by our gp 's in our juniper bonne terre ( historically ) and texland ventures and a farmout with enron 's name on the line <s> it is my job as a vice president to know what requires legal review <s> i have been made aware that farmout agreements and joa 's in directly owned assets ( as opposed to lp 's with a gp such as juniper ) require legal review and signoff <s> the compliance meeting last week underscored that point <s> we had outside counsel ( lisa jaubert ) under your direction review the tri-c and manti farmout agreements and your initials are evidence of your approval <s> i respect you as an attorney and business partner and commit that i will be diligent about obtaining your review of agreements and ask you when in doubt as to whether legal review and approval is required on a particular item or issue <s> the demands that our large oil & gas exploration portfolio places on you is another issue that we should discuss <s> the bonne terre cypress and vastar ventures have significant drilling activity that has commenced and will continue <s> dissolution of bonne terre and distribution of the assets to ena ( to be held in bt exploration llc ) will increase the legal and commercial activity level <s> we have another prospect in cypress that is being promoted and will be spudded in the next DGDG days so expect to see a farmout agreement on the s. riceville prospect late next week <s> i would be pleased to discuss these matters with you and mark haedicke in person if you desire <s> i regret my failure to obtain your review and approval of the kelley farmout agreement and commit to preventing a repeat of the mistake <s> i am concerned about the pace of agreements that we face in the immediate future on our direct-owned ventures <s> i look forward to working with you on ways to better manage our business process in cypress-acadian bonne terre & vastar ventures <s>\n",

'' our concern is that we are committing enron entities to an agreed course of action post-merger based on speculation as to what dynegy may or may not do <s> our suggestion would be that we simply ask f & j to delete all but the first two sentences of paragraph ( DG ) <s> DG. please note that under the terms of this proposed agreement we are not requiring f & j to be liable for the ramp-up costs of new counsel for e.g. the licensing project or the asbestosis cases ( in the event that enron corp. can not be dismissed from the asbestosis cases pre-trial ) <s> we do not believe that ramp-up costs will be something f & j will agree to if we need f & j to take on the new mariner matter <s> mariner 's gc called me today to advise that it was urgent that she know today or tomorrow whether f & j was going to be able to represent mariner on a new critical asset-sale matter that is scheduled to close no later than december DGDG ; otherwise she will need to hire other counsel to handle that matter <s> please let us have your comments as soon as possible <s> britt <s>\n",
