This folder contains a tutorial developed in 2023 on how to:

1. Iteratively scrape key page attributes from a website using BeautifulSoup and process into a stuctured dataset for analysis.
2. Create a simple search engine using tf-idf token vectorizer and geo-distancing in order to return most similar doctor profiles.

This exercise uses the University of Tennessee Medical Center doctor finder as of early 2023.
