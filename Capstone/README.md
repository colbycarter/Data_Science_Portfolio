# Rumble: Predictive Maintenance on Mountain Bikes

In this final Capstone project, our team built a product-oriented data and model pipeline that begins with guided user collection of accelerometer data using a mobile phone, extracts key predictive features for our optimized ML classifiers, and produces component-level degradation predictions on our web application. Included are samples of my contributions, in collaboration with the team. Our team included:

- Luke Evans (lead, data collection and validation, user testing)
- Jesse Calvillo (web application, flask streaming)
- Adam Letcher (research, feature engineering)
- myself (feature engineering, model development)

The final web product can be found below along with a video produced by Luke on how to collect accelerometer data. Enjoy.
